               <p class="BB"> LANGLEY,VA --</a> A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the
                CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black
                highlighters.</p>

             <div>
                <p> Accordingly to the report, sections of the documents--"almost invariably the most crucial passages"-- are marred 
                by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that
                     began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

                <p> CIA Director <b>Porter Goss </b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several 
                    historic events, such as: </p> 
                
            <ul>
                <li>the Cold War</li>
                <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
                <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
            </ul>
